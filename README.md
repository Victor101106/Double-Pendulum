    <h1>Double Pendulum</h1>
    <p>
        In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum also known as a chaos pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, forming a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum">Wikipedia</a>)
